# Pony Smash

## What the hell is this
Pretty sure you know smash or pass, well this is that but with every character in My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic
## Ok but why?
I was bored tbh

## How do i add a character?
* EASY! :D
* First you want to fork this repository
* Create a new branch with the name you want
* Add the **PNG** to the characters folder, you are free to put it in the respective folder it should go to, but i you are unsure put it in `unsorted`
* Add the character to the list inside `index.js` (you will know its the list), in alphabetical order, the `name` property is what appears above the image, and the `img` property is the path to the image ignoring the `characters` folder and no file extension, **ITS CASE SENSITIVE**
* Make a PR (Pull Request) to the branch **`master`**, if you do it to any other branch i will close your PR
* Now your request is for everyone to see, including me :D, so now i can comment on your changes if something is needed, or merge them if everything is fine
