# Pony Smash

## What the hell is this
Pretty sure you know smash or pass, well this is that but with every character in My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic
## Ok but why?
I was bored tbh

## How do i add a character?
### :warning: Rules :warning:
* **No NSFW images**
* **Image has to clearly indicate the character its refering to**
* **OCs are generally not allowed unless its somewhat known (The living tombstone's OC, Discord human form, Cream Heart, etc)**
* **Style has to be the same as other images (2D, same style as the show/2017 movie)**
* **Name has to be correct (duh)**
* **Resolution has to be decent (AT LEAST 256x256), if a higher quality version exists please use it**
* **File format has to be `png` (lowercase extension)**

### Instructions
* EASY! :D
* First you want to fork this repository
* Create a new branch with the name you want
* Add the **PNG** to the characters folder, you are free to put it in the respective folder it should go to, but i you are unsure put it in `unsorted`
* Add the character to the list inside `index.js` (you will know its the list), in alphabetical order
   *  `name`: This is what appears above the image
   *  `img`: The path to the image ignoring the `characters` folder and no file extension, **ITS CASE SENSITIVE**
   *  `filly`: Is the character underage?
   *  `eqg`: Is the character/image from Equestria Girls?
   *  `gender`: `"male"`/`"female"`
   *  `community`: Is the character not officially made by hasbro/Made from the community?
* Make a PR (Pull Request) to the branch **`master`**, if you do it to any other branch i will close your PR
* Now your request is for everyone to see, including me :D, so now i can comment on your changes if something is needed, or merge them if everything is fine
