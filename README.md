# Pony Smash

## What the hell is this
Pretty sure you know smash or pass, well this is that but with every character in My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic
## Ok but why?
I was bored tbh

## How do I add a character?
### Rules
* **No NSFW images**
* **Image has to clearly indicate the character its refering to**
* **OCs are generally not allowed unless its somewhat known (The living tombstone's OC, Discord human form, Cream Heart, etc)**
* **Style has to be the same as other images (2D, same style as the show/2017 movie), OCs are the only exceptions but it's preferable**
* **Name has to be correct (duh)**
* **Resolution has to be decent (AT LEAST 256x256), if a higher quality version exists please use it**
* **File format has to be `png` (lowercase extension)**
